Family-Table is a fake service that connects home cooks to hungry foodies in New York City. Choose a chef to order from and meet them for at the designated pick up location.

#### How is this a fake website?
1. Chefs listed on this website are generated by Chat-GPT.
2. The checkout form does not ask for any real payment.
3. This website does not store information in a database.

## Code Walkthrough

← `public/helpers.js`: Store any client-side DOM manipulation

← `public/style.css`: All styling and CSS are stored here

← `src/pages`: Contains Handlebar templates that render the HTML for each page.

← `src/meals.json`: List of chefs, meal details, and pricing stored in a JSON object.

← `server.js`: NodeJS server that handles any GET and POST request.

## Mentee Preparation
Before your assessment, ensure that you can run the Node server on your computer by following instructions [here](#local-development). This will ensure that you can spend the entirety of the assessment on coding! You will also be expected to share your screen so be sure to only have your code editor, Terminal, Zoom, and web browser open.


## Local Development

1. Ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org) and NPM installed. If not, follow instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). You can simply test if your local environment has Node and NPM by using instructions node -v
npm -v.
2. Clone the repo.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` and open `http://0.0.0.0:52074` in your browser.

## Actual Development
This site is managed by [Emergent Works](https://github.com/emergentworks) and is used to assess individual's full-stack experience.
