Family-Table is a fake service that connects home cooks to hungry foodies in New York City. Choose a chef to order from and meet them for at the designated pick up location.

#### How is this a fake website?
1. Chefs listed on this website are generated by Chat-GPT.
2. The checkout form does not ask for any real payment.
3. This website does not store information in a database.

## Code Walkthrough

← `public/helpers.js`: Store any client-side DOM manipulation

← `public/style.css`: All styling and CSS are stored here

← `src/pages`: Contains Handlebar templates that render the HTML for each page.

← `src/meals.json`: List of chefs, meal details, and pricing stored in a JSON object.

← `server.js`: NodeJS server that handles any GET and POST request.

## Mentee Preparation
Before your assessment, ensure that you can run the Node server on your computer by following instructions [here](#local-development). This will ensure that you can spend the entirety of the assessment on coding!


## Local Development

1. Ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org) and NPM installed. If not, follow instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). You can simply test if your local environment has Node and NPM by using instructions node -v
npm -v.
2. Clone the repo.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` and open `http://0.0.0.0:52074` in your browser.

## Actual Development
This site is managed by [Emergent Works](https://github.com/emergentworks) and is used to assess individual's full-stack experience.
